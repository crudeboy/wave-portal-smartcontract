# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
This is a work of [Ogbeni_jazzwill](https://twitter.com/Ogbeni_jazzwil)(twitter account). This is my first full stack Dapp lauched to the Rinkeyby test net. This is the smart contract and node.js project file lauched using Hardhat and Alchemy.

The project has a test file for development and testing...run.js
To test run the project using hardhat dummy accounts run -> npx hardhat run scripts/run.js 

To deploy the project recreate the .env file using the .env sample

To deploy the project on the rinkeby network run the command -> npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
